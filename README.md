# Tutedude Python Assignment 1 â€“ Module 2: Basic Python Concepts

This repository contains the Python scripts developed as part of **Assignment 1** from the **Tutedude Python Programming Course**, specifically under **Module 2: Basic Python Concepts**. The purpose of this assignment is to practice essential programming fundamentals such as user input, mathematical operations, string manipulation, and output formatting using Python.

The assignment is divided into two tasks. **Task 1** focuses on performing basic mathematical operations. The program prompts the user to input two numbers and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The results of each operation are then displayed clearly to the user. Proper input validation and division error handling are implemented to ensure that the program behaves as expected even with unexpected inputs, such as division by zero.

**Task 2** is designed to work with strings and user interaction. The program collects the user's first name and last name, combines them to form a full name, and then generates a personalized greeting message. This task emphasizes basic string concatenation and the use of print statements to enhance user experience.

The repository includes two Python script files, one for each task, and a `README.md` file that documents the functionality and structure of the project. All scripts are written in Python 3 and follow best practices for readability and clarity. These scripts are beginner-friendly and serve as foundational exercises for anyone learning Python.

To run the programs, simply clone the repository and execute the scripts using a Python 3 interpreter. This assignment reflects a solid understanding of Python basics and demonstrates the ability to solve simple problems using fundamental programming techniques.
